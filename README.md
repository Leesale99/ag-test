# Welcome to the Authentic Gaming Test for Front End Developers.

The purpose to this test is to check how usually you write your code and give us more feedback on your coding level.

Here's your task description:
**The Authentic Gaming Technical Support needs to be able to search in the platform error logs for troubleshooting analysis.**

## Requirements:
* Implement the show/hide result logic on the search button click
* Implement all the *TODOs* into the /js/search-form.js file
* Make it visually nice *(this is the tricky one)*

## Restrictions:
* There are no restrictions... enjoy!

## Files need your attention
* */lib/search-form.js* (business logic)
* */style/search-form.css* (stylesheet)


# How to run the test
1. **Install** [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. **Install** [bower.js](https://bower.io/)
3. **Clone** this github project on your computer
4. Run into a terminal the command **bower install**
5. Run the file **/test.html** by your JavaScript IDE or your local web server

# Project folders and componets
* */conf* contains the requirejs configuration file. You won't need to edit this folder.
* */js* contains the search form business logic
* */lib* will contain all the third parties javascript libraries involved into the project
* */style* contains the stylesheet for the search form

# Technologies involved
This test has been developed using few JS libraries:
* [requirejs](http://requirejs.org/)
* [requirecss](https://github.com/guybedford/require-css)
* [jquery](http://jquery.com/)
* [jquery-ui](https://jqueryui.com/)

You will need some basic knowledge of jquery in order to understand and be able to complete it.

The back-end endpoint has been developed using the [restheart JSON API V2](https://softinstigate.atlassian.net/wiki/display/RH02X/Home).
